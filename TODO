1.  Generation of the NOISE file is slow. Is there a more efficient way?
    a.  Possible timing attack where generation time of noise file -> size of NOISE file?
2.  More comprehensive/useful logging
3.  Better error handling in the queue. Right now if something goes wrong, the job is never tried again and also not cleaned up. "Bury" jobs?
4.  Test Firewall
5.  ext4 and shred effectiveness. Does ext4 overwrite data "in-place"?
6.  Minimizing logs - maybe use part of sha hash as an identifier, instead of filename? Double-check what Apache is logging in error.log.
7.  Log rotation - for both logs from uploadworker, upload cgi, and apache.
8.  Need startup script for beanstalkd
9.  Need to daemonize uploadworker - use python-daemon?

Fixes
-----

1.  gnupg encrypt_file fails silently if there is a problem with the key -- see documentation for details. Added a hack to check for the successful creation of the encrypted file.

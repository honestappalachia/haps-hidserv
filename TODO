0.  Clean up direct upload script as well, so either can be used.
1.  Need to daemonize uploadworker - use python-daemon?
2.  More comprehensive/useful logging
3.  Better error handling in the queue. Right now if something goes wrong, the job is never tried again and also not cleaned up. "Bury" jobs?
4.  Minimizing logs - maybe use part of sha hash as an identifier, instead of filename? Double-check what Apache is logging in error.log.
5.  Log rotation - for both logs from uploadworker, upload cgi, and apache.
6.  Generation of the NOISE file is slow. Is there a more efficient way?
    a.  Possible timing attack where generation time of noise file -> size of NOISE file?

Fixes
-----

1.  gnupg encrypt_file fails silently if there is a problem with the key
    See documentation for details.
    Added a hack to check for the successful creation of the encrypted file.
2.  shred works as usual in ext3/ext4 in data=ordered (default) and data=writeback modes.
    It does not work normally in data=journal mode.
    For more info, see the shred manpage and
    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1662936
    To see what file system you're using, use mount or cat /proc/mounts.
    To see the options you have enabled, cat /etc/fstab.
    According to kernel docs, data=ordered is the default.

    Note that data=writeback may pose a security issue after an unclean shutdown:

3.  honesttables.sh is tested. The hidden service works well and preliminary
    tests show outgoing traffic is being proxied through Tor. Might be able to have a better
    setup using ideas from the Tails VM firewall rules.
4.  The beanstalkd debian package includes a startup script.
    It is configured through /etc/default/beanstalkd
